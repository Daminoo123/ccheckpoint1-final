how does the web works ?
The web browser connects to the web server and sends an HTTP request (via the protocol stack) for the desired web page. The web server receives the request and checks
 for the desired page. If the page exists, the web server sends it. If the server cannot find the requested page, it will send an HTTP 404 error message.
